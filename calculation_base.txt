Subject: Calculating daylight hours by date and latitude

Hello!

This is more of an *answer* than a question. I'm doing some research 
related to seasonal affective disorder, and I needed information about 
how many hours of sunlight different latitudes get at different times 
of the year. I searched your web site, and it looked like a couple 
people had asked this question, but it was hard to answer. Apparently 
it is very difficult to answer because the earth bulges out in the 
middle and hence isn't a sphere and because the earth's orbit is an 
ellipse and not a circle and because the earth wobbles a little, etc.

I did quite a bit of searching, and finally found an article in 
_Ecological Modeling_, volume 80 (1995) pp. 87-95, called "A Model 
Comparison for Daylength as a Function of Latitude and Day of the 
Year." This article presented a model that apparently does a very good 
job of estimating the daylight - the error is less than one minute 
within 40 degrees of the equator, and less than seven minutes within 
60 degrees and usually within two minutes for these latitudes.

I figured that if other people were having trouble finding this 
information, too, maybe it would be worth saving them some time by 
letting you know what I found.  So, here's the model:

   D = daylength
   L = latitude
   J = day of the year

   P = asin[.39795*cos(.2163108 + 2*atan{.9671396*tan[.00860(J-186)]})]

                          _                                         _
                         / sin(0.8333*pi/180) + sin(L*pi/180)*sin(P) \
   D = 24 - (24/pi)*acos{  -----------------------------------------  }
                         \_          cos(L*pi/180)*cos(P)           _/


Use a radian mode here, but latitude should be entered in degrees.

I hope this is helpful!
